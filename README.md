## 🔧 API Setup

### Gemini AI API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### Spotify API Credentials

Song2Meaning uses the **Client Credentials Flow** for Spotify integration, which is perfect for server-side applications that don't require user login.

#### Step 1: Create a Spotify App

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account (create one if needed)
3. Click **"Create app"**
4. Fill in the app details:
   - **App name**: `Song2Meaning` (or your preferred name)
   - **App description**: `AI-powered song analysis with music previews`
   - **Website**: Your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`) or `http://localhost:3000` for development
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3000/callback` (for development)
   - **API/SDKs**: Check **"Web API"**
5. Accept the terms and click **"Save"**

#### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

1. In your newly created app dashboard, you'll see:
   - **Client ID**: A public identifier for your app
   - **Client Secret**: A private key (keep this secure!)
2. Click **"Show client secret"** to reveal it
3. Copy both values - you'll need them for your environment variables

#### Step 3: Configure App Settings (Optional)

For production deployment, update your app settings:

1. Go to **"Settings"** in your Spotify app dashboard
2. Update **"Redirect URIs"** to include your production domain
3. Add your production website URL

> **🔒 Security Note**: The Client Secret should never be exposed in client-side code. Song2Meaning handles this securely by using server-side API routes.

#### Why Client Credentials Flow?

- ✅ **No user login required** - Perfect for public song analysis
- ✅ **Server-side security** - Client secret stays on your server
- ✅ **Simple setup** - No complex OAuth flows
- ✅ **Rate limit friendly** - Suitable for application-level requests

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Spotify Integration Issues

**No music previews showing up?**

- Verify your `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` are correctly set
- Check that your Spotify app is properly configured in the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Note: Not all tracks have preview URLs available from Spotify

**"Spotify API error" messages?**

- Ensure your Spotify app has **"Web API"** enabled
- Check that your Client Secret hasn't been regenerated (this would invalidate the old one)
- Verify your environment variables are properly loaded

**Rate limiting from Spotify?**

- The Client Credentials flow has generous rate limits for most use cases
- If you hit limits, the app will gracefully continue without previews

### General Issues

**"Service configuration error"?**

- Check that all required environment variables are set
- Restart your development server after changing `.env.local`
- Verify your API keys are valid and haven't expired

**Analysis not working?**

- Ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid
- Check the [Gemini API status](https://status.cloud.google.com/)
- Verify you haven't exceeded your Gemini API quota
